I've put together a comprehensive wellness plan specifically tailored to your unique profile, taking into account your age, height, weight, prior powerlifting experience, current activity level, and most importantly, your surgically repaired left rotator cuff.\n",

      "Here's a snapshot of what your plan entails:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Nutritional Focus:** We're looking at approximately **2250 calories per day**, with a strong emphasis on protein (180-220g) to support muscle repair, good carbohydrates for fuel, and healthy fats for overall well-being. Hydration is key, so aim for at least a gallon of water daily.\n",
      "*   **Fitness Approach:** Your rotator cuff health is paramount! We'll start with foundational movements, slowly and deliberately increasing intensity. Your powerlifting background will be an asset, but we'll adapt movements to your current capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan is divided into three phases to ensure progressive adaptation and recovery:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Phase 1: Foundation & Rehabilitation (Weeks 1-4)\n",
      "This phase focuses on re-establishing basic movement patterns, activating stabilizing muscles, and building a cardiovascular base, with a strong emphasis on shoulder mobility and strength. You'll have two full-body strength and mobility sessions per week, two light cardio and core sessions, and two active recovery days. We'll be doing crucial rehab exercises for your shoulder to ensure it's well-supported.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Phase 2: Building Strength & Introducing Compound Lifts (Weeks 5-12)\n",
      "Here, we'll gradually increase resistance and introduce modified powerlifting movements. You'll have dedicated lower body, upper body (shoulder-conscious), and full-body strength days, alongside cardio and active recovery. We'll carefully integrate lifts like squats, Romanian deadlifts, and cautious upper body movements, always prioritizing your shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Phase 3: Strength Progression & Refinement (Weeks 13+)\n",
      "This phase is about progressively increasing intensity and volume, refining your technique, and continuing to build muscle and cardiovascular fitness. We'll have specific lower body strength, upper body hypertrophy, and powerlifting-focused full-body sessions, alongside a mix of moderate and high-intensity cardio.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Throughout this journey, consistent monitoring and listening to your body will be crucial.** We'll be tracking your progress, noting how you feel, and adjusting as needed. If something hurts, we stop and modify. Patience is truly your best friend here, as rebuilding strength after surgery takes time. Celebrate every step forward, no matter how small!\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm incredibly excited for you to embark on this journey. By harmonizing your nutrition and fitness efforts and prioritizing your shoulder health, you are well-positioned to achieve your strength, conditioning, and body composition goals safely and effectively. Let's do this, Hector!\n"
