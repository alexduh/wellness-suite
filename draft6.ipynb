      "*   **Protein Intake:** Prioritize protein to support muscle maintenance and satiety. Aim for **0.8-1 gram per pound of body weight** (approx. 136-170g per day). Distribute this throughout your meals.\n",
      "*   **Food Choices:** Focus on whole, unprocessed foods:\n",
      "    *   **Lean Proteins:** Chicken breast, turkey, fish, lean beef, eggs, Greek yogurt, tofu.\n",
      "    *   **Complex Carbohydrates:** Oats, brown rice, quinoa, sweet potatoes, whole-wheat bread, vegetables.\n",
      "    *   **Healthy Fats:** Avocado, nuts, seeds, olive oil, fatty fish.\n",
      "    *   **Fruits & Vegetables:** A wide variety for vitamins, minerals, and fiber.\n",
      "*   **Hydration:** Drink at least 8-10 glasses of water daily. This aids metabolism, recovery, and overall health.\n",
      "*   **Meal Timing:** Aim for 3-4 balanced meals per day to manage hunger and energy levels. Consider a protein-rich snack if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Synergy & Key Considerations for Phase 1:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Shoulder Health First:** Any hesitation or discomfort during exercises is a signal to stop, modify, or reduce the weight. Consistency with shoulder activation and mobility is non-negotiable.\n",
      "*   **Nutrition Supports Recovery:** Adequate protein and calories (within the deficit) are vital for muscle repair and preventing muscle loss during this foundational phase. Hydration also plays a key role in recovery.\n",
      "*   **Listen to Your Body:** This applies to both fitness and nutrition. If you're feeling excessively fatigued or overly hungry, we may need to slightly adjust the calorie deficit or meal timing.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Phase 2: Strength & Hypertrophy (6-8 Weeks)\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you've established a pain-free base and your shoulder feels strong and stable, we can gradually increase the intensity and volume to stimulate muscle growth and strength gains.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Fitness Component:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Frequency:** 4 days per week, split routine.\n",
      "*   **Focus:** Increasing strength on key compound lifts and adding volume for hypertrophy.\n",

      "*   **Day 1:** Upper Body (Push Focus)\n",

      "*   **Day 5:** Lower Body / Full Body Conditioning\n",
      "*   **Day 6:** Rest\n",
      "*   **Day 7:** Rest\n",
      "\n",
      "*(Specific exercises for Phase 2 are detailed in the Fitness Trainer's original plan, including barbell variations where appropriate, but always with the caveat of prioritizing pain-free range of motion for your shoulder.)*\n",
      "\n",
      "**Nutrition Component:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Caloric Intake:** Maintain a **moderate caloric deficit (300-500 calories)**. As you gain muscle and potentially increase your non-exercise activity, your maintenance calories might increase slightly. Re-evaluate and adjust as needed.\n",
      "*   **Protein Intake:** Continue to prioritize protein at **0.8-1 gram per pound of body weight**. This is crucial for muscle repair and growth during this hypertrophy-focused phase.\n",
      "*   **Carbohydrate Timing:** Consider consuming a good portion of your daily carbohydrates around your workouts (pre and post-training) to fuel performance and aid recovery.\n",
      "*   **Micronutrients:** Continue to focus on a wide variety of fruits and vegetables to ensure you're getting essential vitamins and minerals that support energy production, immune function, and recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Synergy & Key Considerations for Phase 2:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Fueling Performance:** Adequate carbohydrates around your workouts will enhance your ability to push harder during training, leading to better strength and muscle-building stimuli.\n",
      "*   **Muscle Protein Synthesis:** Consistent protein intake supports the increased demand on your muscles from higher training intensity and volume.\n",
      "*   **Continued Shoulder Vigilance:** While increasing weight, remain hyper-aware of your shoulder. If any exercise causes discomfort, revert to dumbbell variations or modify as needed. Face pulls and other corrective exercises become even more important.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Phase 3: Peaking / Continued Progress (Ongoing)\n",
      "\n",
      "This phase involves more sophisticated training periodization and can be adjusted based on your progress and how your body responds.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Fitness Component:**\n",
      "*   **Frequency:** 4-5 days per week.\n",
      "*   **Focus:** Cycling intensity and volume, potentially incorporating more advanced training techniques, and addressing any lagging areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Split (5 Days):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Day 1:** Lower Body (Strength Focus)\n",
      "*   **Day 2:** Upper Body (Push Focus)\n",
      "*   **Day 3:** Rest or Active Recovery\n",
      "*   **Day 4:** Lower Body (Hypertrophy Focus)\n",
      "*   **Day 5:** Upper Body (Pull Focus)\n",
      "*   **Day 6:** Full Body Conditioning / Weak Point Training (e.g., extra shoulder work, core)\n",
      "*   **Day 7:** Rest\n",
      "\n",
      "*(Again, refer to the Fitness Trainer's detailed plan for exercise specifics in this phase, always with shoulder safety as the priority.)*\n",
      "\n",
      "**Nutrition Component:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Caloric Intake:** You may need to adjust your deficit slightly as your body becomes more efficient or if you stall. Continuing with a **300-500 calorie deficit** is generally effective for sustained fat loss while building muscle.\n",
      "*   **Nutrient Timing Flexibility:** As you become more attuned to your body, you can experiment with nutrient timing, but the cornerstone remains **consistent high protein intake and sufficient calories** to support muscle growth within your deficit.\n",
      "*   **Listen to Hunger Cues:** As your activity level increases, your appetite may change. Pay attention to your hunger and satiety signals to help guide your intake.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Synergy & Key Considerations for Phase 3:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Advanced Recovery:** With higher training frequency and intensity, recovery becomes even more critical. Prioritize sleep (7-9 hours), stress management, and active recovery. Nutrition plays a direct role in supporting these recovery processes.\n",
      "*   **Adaptability:** This phase is about continuous adaptation. Monitor your progress closely (training logs, body measurements) and be prepared to adjust both your training and nutrition based on results.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### General Principles for Long-Term Success:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Rotator Cuff Health is Paramount:**\n",
      "    *   **Always Warm-Up Thoroughly:** Pay special attention to your shoulder activation and mobility drills before every workout.\n",
      "    *   **Listen to Your Body:** Pain is a signal. Do not push through sharp or pinching pain in your shoulder. Modify, substitute, or rest.\n",
      "    *   **Focus on Form:** Perfect technique over heavy weight, especially on upper body pressing movements.\n",
      "    *   **Strengthen Supporting Muscles:** Continue with exercises like face pulls, band pull-aparts, and external rotations regularly.\n",
      "*   **Cardiovascular Health:**\n",
      "    *   **LISS (Low-Intensity Steady State):** Aim for 2-3 sessions per week, 30-45 minutes (e.g., brisk walking, cycling). This aids fat burning and recovery.\n",
      "    *   **HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training):** Consider 1-2 sessions per week, 15-20 minutes, *only if your shoulder allows and is pain-free*. This can boost metabolism.\n",
      "    *   **Integration:** Cardio can be done on rest days or after weight training.\n",
      "*   **Sleep & Recovery:**\n",
      "    *   **Target 7-9 Hours:** Quality sleep is essential for muscle repair, hormone regulation, and fat loss.\n",
      "    *   **Manage Stress:** High stress can hinder progress. Incorporate stress-management techniques (e.g., mindfulness, deep breathing, hobbies).\n",
      "*   **Consistency is Key:** Adhering to the plan consistently, even on days when motivation is low, will yield the best results.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Before You Start:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Consult Your Doctor/Physical Therapist:** Given your surgical history, it's highly recommended to get clearance from your healthcare provider before beginning this program.\n",
      "2.  **Start Conservatively:** Begin with Phase 1, focusing on mastering movements and ensuring your shoulder is comfortable.\n",
      "3.  **Track Everything:** Keep a detailed training log and consider tracking your food intake initially to understand your habits and ensure you're hitting your targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hector, this integrated plan provides a roadmap.
