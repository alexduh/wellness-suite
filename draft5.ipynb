      "**Your Personalized Wellness Plan: Hector's Transformation**\n",
      "\n",
      "Welcome, Hector! It's fantastic that you're ready to embrace a healthier lifestyle. Your prior powerlifting experience is a significant asset, and this plan is designed to leverage that foundation while prioritizing your shoulder's recovery and long-term health. We'll focus on a synergistic approach where nutrition fuels your workouts and recovery, and your training optimizes fat loss and muscle gain.\n",
      "\n",
      "**I. Overarching Goals:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Primary:**\n",
      "    *   Lose 10-15 pounds of body fat.\n",
      "    *   Gain 5-10 pounds of lean muscle mass.\n",
      "*   **Secondary:**\n",
      "    *   Enhance cardiovascular health and endurance.\n",
      "    *   Increase overall strength safely and sustainably.\n",
      "    *   Establish a consistent and enjoyable fitness routine.\n",
      "\n",
      "**II. Time Frame & Phased Approach:**\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll progress through three distinct phases to ensure a safe and effective journey:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Foundation & Rehabilitation:** Focus on re-establishing proper movement patterns, building core stability, and meticulously rehabilitating your shoulder. We'll prioritize form over weight.\n",
      "*   **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-12): Strength & Hypertrophy:** Gradually increase training intensity and volume, introduce more challenging compound exercises, and stimulate muscle growth.\n",
      "*   **Phase 3 (Weeks 13+): Continued Progress & Maintenance:** Implement more advanced training principles, focus on progressive overload for sustained gains, and maintain a healthy lifestyle long-term.\n",
      "\n",
      "**III. Nutrition Plan: Fueling Your Progress**\n",
      "\n",
      "Since you have no dietary restrictions, we'll focus on a balanced, nutrient-dense approach to support both fat loss and muscle building.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Calorie Management for Fat Loss:** To achieve a healthy rate of fat loss (0.5-1 lb per week), we'll operate in a slight calorie deficit.\n",
      "    *   **Target Intake:** Based on your stats (30-year-old male, 5'6\", 170 lbs), your estimated Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is roughly 2400-2600 calories. We'll aim for an initial intake of **1900-2100 calories per day**. This can be adjusted based on your progress, energy levels, and hunger.\n",
      "*   **Protein for Muscle Synthesis & Satiety:** Adequate protein is crucial for muscle repair and growth, and it also helps you feel fuller for longer.\n",
      "    *   **Target Intake:** Aim for **0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight**. For you, this is **136-170 grams of protein per day**. Distribute this protein intake throughout your meals and snacks.\n",
      "    *   **Lean Protein Sources:** Chicken breast, turkey, lean beef, fish (salmon, tuna), eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, tofu, lentils, and protein powder.\n",
      "*   **Balanced Macronutrients:** The remainder of your calories will come from carbohydrates and healthy fats.\n",
      "    *   **Complex Carbohydrates:** Prioritize whole grains (oats, brown rice, quinoa), starchy vegetables (sweet potatoes, potatoes), fruits, and non-starchy vegetables (broccoli, spinach, bell peppers). These provide sustained energy for workouts and essential nutrients.\n",
      "    *   **Healthy Fats:** Incorporate sources like avocados, nuts (almonds, walnuts), seeds (chia, flax), olive oil, and fatty fish. Fats are important for hormone production and overall health.\n",
      "*   **Hydration:** Crucial for performance, recovery, and metabolism.\n",
      "    *   **Target Intake:** Aim for at least **8-10 glasses (64-80 oz) of water per day**. Increase intake on training days and in warmer weather.\n",
      "*   **Meal Timing (General Guidance):**\n",
      "    *   Distribute your protein intake across 3-5 meals/snacks to optimize muscle protein synthesis.\n",
      "    *   Consider consuming a balanced meal or snack containing protein and carbohydrates 1-2 hours before your workout and within 1-2 hours post-workout to aid recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "**IV. Fitness Plan: Rebuilding & Growing**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Critical Considerations for Your Rotator Cuff Injury:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Physician/PT Clearance:** **This is non-negotiable.** Before starting *any* new exercise, consult your doctor or physical therapist. They can provide specific guidance on movements to avoid, acceptable ranges of motion, and any exercises they recommend for your rehabilitation.\n",
      "*   **Pain is Your Guide:** Never push through sharp or persistent shoulder pain. Discomfort is okay, but sharp pain is a signal to stop, reduce weight, modify the exercise, or choose an alternative.\n",
      "*   **Form is Paramount:** With your powerlifting background, you know the importance of form. For your shoulder's safety, perfect form is even more critical. Start lighter than you think you need to and focus on controlled, deliberate movements.\n",
      "*   **Prehab & Warm-up:** A dedicated warm-up focusing on shoulder mobility and rotator cuff activation is essential *before every workout*.\n",
      "*   **Cool-down & Mobility:** Include static stretching and mobility work post-workout, paying attention to your shoulders and upper back.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 1: Foundation and Rehabilitation (Weeks 1-4)**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Frequency:** 3 days per week, full-body workouts. Prioritize recovery on off days.\n",
      "*   **Focus:** Neuromuscular re-education, mastering form, shoulder stability, and building a base level of conditioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample Weekly Schedule:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Day 1: Full Body A**\n",
      "*   **Day 2: Active Recovery / Light Cardio** (e.g., brisk walking, cycling, swimming – focus on low impact)\n",
      "*   **Day 3: Full Body B**\n",
      "*   **Day 4: Rest**\n",
      "*   **Day 5: Full Body A**\n",
      "*   **Day 6: Active Recovery / Light Cardio**\n",
      "*   **Day 7: Rest**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Warm-up (10-15 minutes before each workout):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Cardio:** 5 minutes of light cardio (e.g., jogging in place, arm circles while moving) to increase blood flow.\n",
      "*   **Dynamic Stretching:** Arm swings (forward/backward, controlled), leg swings, torso twists.\n",
      "*   **Rotator Cuff Activation (use light resistance bands or no weight):**\n",
      "    *   External Rotations: 2 sets x 15 reps\n",
      "    *   Internal Rotations: 2 sets x 15 reps\n",
      "    *   Scapular Retractions (focus on squeezing shoulder blades): 2 sets x 15 reps\n",
      "    *   Band Pull-Aparts (light band, focus on rear delts and upper back): 2 sets x 15 reps\n",
      "\n",
      "**Full Body Workout A:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Bodyweight Squats:** 3 sets x 10-12 reps (Focus on depth and proper knee tracking.)\n",

      "*   **Calorie Deficit & Muscle Retention:** While in a calorie deficit for fat loss, sufficient protein and consistent strength training are crucial to signal your body to preserve (and even build) muscle mass, rather than breaking it down for energy.\n",
      "*   **Recovery is Key:** Both proper nutrition (especially protein and carbohydrates) and adequate rest (sleep being paramount) are vital for muscle recovery and adaptation. Neglecting one will hinder progress in the other.\n",
      "*   **Hydration Enhances Performance:** Staying well-hydrated ensures optimal muscle function, nutrient transport, and waste removal, directly impacting your workout quality and recovery.\n",

      "**VI. Key Principles for Sustainable Success:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Consistency is King:** Adherence to both your training and nutrition plan is the most critical factor. Aim for consistency over perfection.\n",
      "2.  **Patience & Long-Term Vision:** Building muscle and losing fat is a marathon, not a sprint. Trust the process and celebrate milestones along the way.\n",
      "3.  **Prioritize Recovery:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Manage stress through appropriate methods. This is when your body rebuilds and adapts.\n",
      "4.  **Listen to Your Body (Especially Your Shoulder):** Never ignore pain signals. Be willing to adjust your plan based on how you feel.\n",
      "5.  **Progressive Overload:** Continuously challenge yourself by gradually increasing weight, reps, sets, or decreasing rest times as you get stronger and fitter.\n",
