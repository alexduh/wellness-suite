# draft notes

final draft goals: (ready by Friday, sat-sun for presentation creation / final touches)

implements the following: (1-4 to have a working demo, 5 for qc, 6-8 if time)

1. a multi agent system with the following:
    - Agent powered by an LLM (gemini)
    - Parallel agents (call both/all 'domain expert' agents in parallel)
    - Sequential agent (nest parallel agents within? optional)

2. Tools:
    - MCP (ask Alex?)
    - Custom tools (if macros-calculation agent is not readily available)
    - built-in tools (google search, code execution)

3. Sessions & Memory
    - Sessions & state management (good for prototyping)
    - Long term memory (if pointmaxing)

4. Context engineering
    - See day3a for compaction_demo

5. Observability
    - Logging
    - Tracing
    - Metrics

6. Agent evaluation

7. A2A Protocol

8. Agent Deployment

## draft1

2. custom tools for session state management (could be useful for storing key wellness info in session state)

3. sessions + db

4. added compaction

# draft5

why doesn't nutritionist work?
