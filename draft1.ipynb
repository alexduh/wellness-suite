      "\n",
      "First, let's establish some baseline information:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Age:** 30 years old\n",
      "*   **Sex:** Male\n",
      "*   **Weight:** 170 lbs\n",
      "*   **Height:** 5'6\" (66 inches)\n",
      "*   **Goal:** Lose 20 lbs (target weight of 150 lbs) and gain muscle.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Understanding Your Needs:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To lose fat, you need to be in a calorie deficit. To gain muscle, you need adequate protein intake and resistance training. The key is to create a deficit that is not so severe that it hinders muscle growth or recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Calorie and Macronutrient Targets:**\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll start by estimating your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and then your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **BMR (Harris-Benedict Equation):**\n",
      "    *   For men: BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 × weight in kg) + (4.799 × height in cm) - (5.677 × age in years)\n",
      "    *   Weight in kg: 170 lbs / 2.20462 = 77.11 kg\n",
      "    *   Height in cm: 66 inches × 2.54 = 167.64 cm\n",
      "    *   BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 × 77.11) + (4.799 × 167.64) - (5.677 × 30)\n",
      "    *   BMR = 88.362 + 1033.21 + 804.55 - 170.31\n",
      "    *   **BMR ≈ 1755 calories**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure):** This accounts for your activity level. Given your \"previous lifting and cardio experience\" and intention to get back into it, I'll estimate an **\"Moderately Active\"** level (exercise 3-5 days/week).\n",
      "    *   TDEE = BMR × Activity Factor\n",
      "    *   Activity Factor for Moderately Active: 1.55\n",

      "    *   **TDEE ≈ 2720 calories**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Calorie Target for Fat Loss and Muscle Gain:**\n",
      "    *   To lose approximately 1 lb of fat per week, you generally need a deficit of 500 calories per day. However, for muscle gain alongside fat loss, a more conservative deficit is recommended to preserve muscle mass and energy levels.\n",
      "    *   We'll aim for a deficit of **300-500 calories** per day.\n",
      "    *   **Target Calorie Intake: 2200 - 2400 calories per day.** Let's start with **2300 calories** as a good middle ground. We can adjust this based on your progress and how you feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Macronutrient Breakdown (for ~2300 calories):**\n",
      "    *   **Protein:** Crucial for muscle repair and growth, and helps with satiety. Aim for 0.8-1 gram per pound of body weight.\n",
      "        *   Target: 170 lbs × 1 g/lb = **170 grams of protein** (170g × 4 calories/g = 680 calories)\n",
      "    *   **Fats:** Essential for hormone production and overall health. Aim for 20-30% of your total calories.\n",
      "        *   Target: 2300 calories × 0.25 = 575 calories from fat (575 calories / 9 calories/g = **~64 grams of fat**)\n",
      "    *   **Carbohydrates:** Provide energy for workouts and daily activities. The remaining calories will come from carbs.\n",
      "        *   Calories remaining: 2300 - 680 (protein) - 575 (fat) = 1045 calories\n",
      "        *   Target: 1045 calories / 4 calories/g = **~261 grams of carbohydrates**\n",

      "    *   Hard-boiled eggs (2) and a small handful of almonds\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Notes for Meal Planning:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Hydration:** Drink at least 8-10 glasses (64-80 oz) of water throughout the day. More if you're sweating heavily during workouts.\n",
      "*   **Fiber:** Aim for 25-35 grams of fiber daily from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n",
      "*   **Variety:** Feel free to swap out similar foods to keep things interesting. For example, chicken breast for turkey breast, salmon for cod, quinoa for brown rice, broccoli for green beans, etc.\n",
      "*   **Portion Control:** Use measuring cups and a food scale initially to ensure you're hitting your targets accurately.\n",
      "*   **Listen to Your Body:** If you're feeling excessively hungry or low on energy, we may need to slightly increase calories or adjust macronutrient distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Micronutrient Needs:**\n",
      "\n",
      "By focusing on whole, unprocessed foods, you'll naturally obtain a wide range of vitamins and minerals.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Calcium & Vitamin D:** Important for bone health, especially with resistance training. Found in dairy (if consumed), fortified plant milks, leafy greens, and fatty fish.\n",
      "*   **Iron:** Crucial for energy and oxygen transport. Found in red meat, poultry, fish, beans, and leafy greens.\n",
      "*   **Magnesium:** Involved in muscle function and energy production. Found in leafy greens, nuts, seeds, and whole grains.\n",
      "*   **Potassium:** Important for fluid balance and muscle contractions. Found in bananas, sweet potatoes, spinach, and beans.\n",
      "*   **Vitamins A, C, E:** Antioxidants that support overall health and recovery. Abundant in fruits and vegetables.\n",
      "*   **B Vitamins:** Essential for energy metabolism. Found in whole grains, lean meats, eggs, and dairy.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Supplementation (Optional, but can be beneficial):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Whey Protein/Plant-Based Protein:** Convenient for hitting protein targets, especially post-workout.\n",
      "*   **Creatine Monohydrate:** Well-researched supplement proven to improve strength, power, and muscle mass. 5g per day is a standard dose.\n",
      "*   **Multivitamin:** A good insurance policy to cover any potential micronutrient gaps, especially during a calorie deficit.\n",
      "*   **Omega-3 Fatty Acids (Fish Oil):** Can help with inflammation and overall cardiovascular health.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Exercise Recommendation (Crucial for Muscle Gain):**\n",
      "\n",
      "This nutrition plan is designed to support your fitness goals. To effectively lose 20 lbs and gain muscle, you'll need a structured exercise routine.\n",
      "\n",

      "### Physiological Principles for Your Goals\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Weight Loss (Fat Loss):** This is achieved through a caloric deficit. You need to expend more calories than you consume.\n",
      "*   **Muscle Gain (Hypertrophy):** This requires progressive overload (gradually increasing the demand on your muscles), adequate protein intake, and sufficient recovery.\n",
      "*   **Body Recomposition:** The goal of losing fat and gaining muscle simultaneously is known as body recomposition. This is most feasible for individuals returning to training or those new to resistance training. It requires a careful balance of nutrition and training.\n",

      "## Detailed Wellness Plan\n",
      "\n",
      "This plan is structured as a 4-week cycle, with progressive adjustments. It assumes you are cleared for general exercise and have no major contraindications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Phase 1: Foundation & Re-Acclimation (Weeks 1-4)\n",
      "\n",
      "The focus here is on re-establishing good movement patterns, rebuilding a base level of strength and cardiovascular fitness, and establishing consistent habits.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. Nutrition Strategy\n",
      "\n",
      "The cornerstone of fat loss and muscle gain is nutrition. You'll need to be in a slight caloric deficit.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Caloric Target:**\n",
      "    *   **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Estimate (using Mifflin-St Jeor Equation):** (10 * weight in kg) + (6.25 * height in cm) - (5 * age in years) + 5\n",

      "        *   Height: 5'6\" = (5 * 12 + 6) inches = 66 inches * 2.54 = 167.6 cm\n",
      "        *   BMR = (10 * 77.1) + (6.25 * 167.6) - (5 * 30) + 5 = 771 + 1047.5 - 150 + 5 = **1673.5 calories**\n",
      "    *   **Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) Estimate:** BMR * Activity Factor. Let's assume a moderately active lifestyle (exercising 3-5 days/week). Activity Factor: 1.55\n",
      "        *   TDEE = 1673.5 * 1.55 = **2594 calories** (approximate maintenance calories)\n",
      "    *   **Caloric Deficit for Fat Loss:** To lose ~1 lb per week, aim for a deficit of 500 calories/day.\n",
      "        *   **Target Daily Calories:** 2594 - 500 = **2094 calories**. Let's round this to **2100 calories per day**.\n",
      "        *   **Flexibility:** If you feel excessively fatigued or are losing weight too quickly (more than 2 lbs/week), increase calories slightly (e.g., to 2200-2300). If weight loss stalls, you might need to slightly reduce intake or increase activity.\n",
      "*   **Macronutrient Breakdown:**\n",
      "    *   **Protein:** Crucial for muscle repair and satiety. Aim for 0.8-1 gram per pound of body weight.\n",
      "        *   Target: 150-170 grams per day.\n",
      "    *   **Fats:** Essential for hormone production and overall health. Aim for 20-30% of total calories.\n",
      "        *   Target: (2100 * 0.25) / 9 calories per gram = ~58 grams per day.\n",
      "    *   **Carbohydrates:** Fuel for workouts and daily function. Fill the remaining calories.\n",
      "        *   Target: 2100 (total) - (160g protein * 4 cal/g) - (60g fat * 9 cal/g) = 2100 - 640 - 540 = 920 calories.\n",
      "        *   920 calories / 4 calories per gram = **230 grams of carbohydrates per day**.\n",
      "*   **Food Quality:**\n",
      "    *   **Lean Protein Sources:** Chicken breast, turkey, lean beef, fish (salmon, tuna), eggs, Greek yogurt, tofu, lentils, beans.\n",
      "    *   **Complex Carbohydrates:** Oats, brown rice, quinoa, whole-wheat bread/pasta, sweet potatoes, fruits, vegetables.\n",
      "    *   **Healthy Fats:** Avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, fatty fish.\n",
      "    *   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day (aim for 1 gallon).\n",
      "*   **Meal Timing:** Distribute protein intake evenly across meals (3-5 meals/snacks) to optimize muscle protein synthesis. Consume carbs around your workouts for energy.\n",

      "2.  **Proper Form:** Always prioritize form over lifting heavier weight. Watch reputable instructional videos, record yourself, and consider a few sessions with a qualified trainer.\n",
      "3.  **Warm-up & Cool-down:** Never skip these. They prepare your body and aid recovery.\n",
      "4.  **Consistency:** Adherence is more important than perfection. Missed a workout? Get back on track with the next one. Skipped a meal? Make up for it nutritionally later.\n",
      "5.  **Patience & Realistic Expectations:** Losing 20 lbs and gaining muscle takes time. Aim for sustainable progress (1-2 lbs fat loss per week). Visible muscle gain takes consistent effort over weeks and months.\n",
      "6.  **Sleep:** Non-negotiable for recovery and hormone balance. Aim for 7-9 hours.\n",
      "7.  **Stress Management:** Chronic stress hinders progress. Find healthy outlets.\n",
