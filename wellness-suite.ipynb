      "\n",
      "*   **Protein:** 140-170g/day (30-35% of calories) - Crucial for muscle repair and growth.\n",
      "*   **Fats:** 47-60g/day (25-30% of calories) - Essential for hormone function and overall health.\n",
      "*   **Carbohydrates:** 140-170g/day (35-40% of calories) - Provides energy for workouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Nutritional Strategies:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Prioritize Protein:** Distribute protein intake evenly across 4-5 meals/snacks throughout the day to optimize muscle protein synthesis.\n",
      "2.  **Pre- & Post-Workout Nutrition:**\n",
      "    *   **Pre-workout (1-2 hours before):** A meal with complex carbs and some protein for sustained energy.\n",
      "    *   **Post-workout (within 1-2 hours after):** Focus on protein and carbohydrates to kickstart recovery and replenish glycogen stores.\n",
      "3.  **Hydration:** Aim for at least 8-10 glasses (64-80 oz) of water daily, increasing around workouts. Proper hydration is vital for metabolism and recovery.\n",
      "4.  **Micronutrient Focus for Recovery:**\n",
      "    *   **Vitamin C:** Supports collagen synthesis (citrus, berries, bell peppers).\n",
      "    *   **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Reduce inflammation (fatty fish, flaxseeds, walnuts).\n",
      "    *   **Zinc:** Aids wound healing (oysters, beef, pumpkin seeds).\n",

      "*   **Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. This is critical for muscle repair, hormone regulation, and overall recovery.\n",
      "*   **Active Recovery:** On rest days, engage in light activities like walking, gentle cycling, or yoga. This promotes blood flow to aid recovery without taxing your body.\n",
      "*   **Stress Management:** Chronic stress can hinder progress. Incorporate stress-reducing activities like meditation, deep breathing, or spending time outdoors.\n",
      "*   **Listen to Your Body:** This is paramount, especially with your shoulder injury. Pay attention to fatigue levels, hunger cues, and any discomfort. Adjust workouts and nutrition as needed.\n",
      "*   **Regular Assessment:** After 4-6 weeks, evaluate your progress. How are you feeling? Are you seeing strength gains? Is your weight changing as desired? Adjust the plan based on your feedback and results. If your shoulder feels robust, you can cautiously increase intensity.\n",
