      "\n",
      "**Phase 1: Foundation & Adaptation (Weeks 1-4)**\n",

      "*   **Meal Timing:**\n",
      "    *   **Pre-Workout (1-2 hours prior):** Focus on easily digestible carbs and some protein. Examples: Oatmeal with berries and protein powder, banana with a small handful of almonds.\n",
      "    *   **Post-Workout (within 1-2 hours):** Prioritize protein and carbohydrates for recovery. Examples: Protein shake with a banana, grilled chicken with sweet potato.\n",
      "    *   **Throughout the Day:** Aim for 3 main meals and 1-2 snacks to maintain energy and nutrient supply.\n",
      "*   **Food Choices:** Focus on nutrient-dense whole foods.\n",

      "    *   **Complex Carbs:** Oats, quinoa, brown rice, whole grains, sweet potatoes, fruits, vegetables.\n",
      "    *   **Healthy Fats:** Avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, fatty fish.\n",
      "*   **Hydration:** Aim for at least 0.5-1 ounce of water per pound of body weight (approx. 85-170 oz daily).\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Flexibility & Mobility (Daily)**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Incorporate light stretching and mobility work, with specific attention to:\n",
      "    *   **Shoulder Health:** Cat-Cow, thoracic rotations, **gentle** shoulder dislocations with a band/broomstick (light resistance, controlled range of motion), external/internal rotations with light bands.\n",
      "    *   **Hips and Thoracic Spine:** Hip flexor stretches, cat-cow, thoracic rotations.\n",

      "\n",
      "As your body adapts, we'll gradually increase the challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Fitness:**\n",
      "    *   **Strength Training:**\n",
      "        *   Increase resistance on exercises where you consistently hit the higher rep range.\n",
      "        *   Consider slightly lower rep ranges (8-10) for compound lifts if form is perfect and your shoulder feels strong.\n",
      "        *   **Introduce variations cautiously:** Barbell squats (if shoulder allows and form is impeccable), Barbell RDLs, Barbell Overhead Press (start very light, prioritize form and shoulder comfort).\n",
      "        *   Add one additional set to 1-2 key exercises.\n",
      "    *   **Cardiovascular Training:**\n",
      "        *   Increase duration to 45-50 minutes.\n",
      "        *   **Consider introducing HIIT once per week:** e.g., 30 seconds sprint/high effort, 60 seconds recovery, repeat 8-10 times. **Monitor shoulder response closely.**\n",
      "*   **Nutrition:**\n",
      "    *   **Monitor Progress:** If weight loss stalls for 2 weeks, slightly reduce calories by ~100-150 kcal. If you feel excessively fatigued or are losing weight too rapidly, increase by ~100-150 kcal, focusing on carbs and protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 3: Intensification & Specialization (Weeks 9+)**\n",
      "\n",
      "Continue to build upon your established foundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Fitness:**\n",
      "    *   **Strength Training:**\n",
      "        *   Consider an **Upper/Lower split** or **Push/Pull/Legs (PPL) split** if recovery allows and you desire more volume per muscle group.\n",
      "        *   **Introduce powerlifting-style rep ranges (5-8)** for key compound lifts (squat, bench press, deadlift variants) *only if shoulder stability and form are excellent.*\n",
      "        *   **Continue to prioritize shoulder health:** Include dedicated rotator cuff strengthening (external/internal rotations with bands/cables, light weight, controlled), and robust upper back work (face pulls, rows, rear delt flyes).\n",
      "    *   **Cardiovascular Training:** Maintain a balanced mix of steady-state and HIIT, adjusted to your recovery and overall energy levels.\n",
      "*   **Nutrition:**\n",
      "    *   **Fine-tune Macros:** Adjust macronutrient ratios based on your body composition changes and how you feel. For example, if muscle gain is a higher priority, you might slightly increase calories from protein and complex carbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Synergies & Integrations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Nutrition for Recovery:** Adequate protein intake (170g) is crucial for muscle repair after your strength training sessions. Timing your protein and carbohydrate intake around workouts will optimize this process.\n",
      "*   **Energy for Performance:** The ~149g of carbohydrates provides the fuel needed for your workouts, especially as you progress to heavier lifting. Prioritizing complex carbs ensures sustained energy release.\n",
      "*   **Joint Health:** Healthy fats (avocado, nuts, seeds, fatty fish) provide essential fatty acids that can help manage inflammation, which is beneficial for your rotator cuff.\n",
      "*   **Hydration:** Proper hydration is essential for nutrient transport, energy levels, and overall joint lubrication, supporting both your fitness and recovery.\n",
      "*   **Weight Management:** The slight caloric deficit (~1700 kcal) will drive weight loss, making your workouts more effective for body recomposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Monitoring Your Progress:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Weight:** Weigh yourself 1-2 times weekly, consistently (e.g., first thing in the morning). Focus on weekly averages, not daily fluctuations.\n",
      "*   **Body Measurements:** Take measurements (waist, hips, chest, arms) every 2-4 weeks.\n",
      "*   **Progress Photos:** Take photos every 4 weeks to visually track changes.\n",
      "*   **Training Log:** Record weights, reps, and sets. Aim for gradual improvement (e.g., adding 5 lbs, completing an extra rep) each week or two.\n",
      "*   **Subjective Feelings:** Pay close attention to your energy levels, sleep quality, mood, and any pain or discomfort, especially around your shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Crucial Reminders:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Listen to Your Body (Especially Your Shoulder):** This is non-negotiable. Never push through sharp or persistent pain. Modify exercises, reduce weight, or skip an exercise if necessary. **Consult with a physical therapist or doctor regarding specific shoulder rehabilitation exercises.**\n",
      "*   **Consistency is Paramount:** Adherence to this plan over time will yield the best results. Don't let minor setbacks derail your progress.\n",
      "*   **Sleep is Your Recovery Ally:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep nightly. This is when muscle repair and growth primarily occur.\n",
      "*   **Stress Management:** High stress levels can negatively impact hormone balance and recovery. Find healthy outlets for stress.\n",
      "*   **Warm-up & Cool-down:** Never skip these. They prepare your body for exercise and aid in recovery.\n",
      "\n",
