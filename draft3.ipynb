      "## Integrated Wellness Plan\n",
      "\n",
      "This plan is designed to help you improve overall fitness, lose weight, maintain or build muscle mass, and build strength, with a strong emphasis on protecting your surgically repaired left rotator cuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "### I. Fitness Plan: Phased Approach to Strength and Health\n",
      "\n",
      "Your fitness journey will be guided by a phased approach, prioritizing shoulder health and gradual progression.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 1: Foundation & Shoulder Rehab (Weeks 1-4)**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Goal:** Re-introduce movement, establish proper form, activate key muscle groups, and begin targeted shoulder rehabilitation.\n",
      "*   **Frequency:** 3 days/week full-body resistance training (at least one rest day between sessions) + 2-3 days/week light cardio.\n",
      "*   **Key Focus:** Bodyweight and very light resistance, perfect form, specific shoulder warm-up/rehab exercises (scapular squeezes, band pull-aparts, external/internal rotations).\n",
      "*   **Sample Exercises:** Bodyweight squats, knee/incline push-ups, glute bridges, bird dog, light dumbbell rows (perfect form), plank, pallof press.\n",
      "*   **Cardio:** 20-30 minutes of low-to-moderate intensity (brisk walking, cycling, swimming).\n",
      "*   **Crucial:** Listen to your body, especially your shoulder. Stop if you feel pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 2: Gradual Progression & Lighter Weights (Weeks 5-12)**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Goal:** Increase resistance, solidify compound lift technique, build muscular endurance, and strengthen the shoulder complex.\n",
      "*   **Frequency:** 3 days/week full-body resistance training + 2-3 days/week cardio.\n",
      "*   **Key Focus:** Introduce light dumbbells/kettlebells, continue shoulder prehab, focus on controlled movements.\n",
      "*   **Sample Exercises:** Goblet squats, incline dumbbell bench press (light), single-arm dumbbell rows, Romanian deadlifts (RDLs), *cautious* dumbbell overhead press (or substitutions like lateral raises/face pulls if any discomfort), lat pulldowns, plank variations, pallof press.\n",
      "*   **Cardio:** 30-40 minutes of moderate intensity.\n",
      "*   **Crucial:** Only increase weight when form is perfect. Monitor shoulder closely.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 3: Building Strength & Volume (Months 3-6)**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Goal:** Increase weight on compound lifts, build muscle mass and strength.\n",
      "*   **Frequency:** 3-4 days/week (can be full-body or a simple split like Upper/Lower).\n",
      "*   **Key Focus:** Progressive overload on key lifts, solidifying lifting habits.\n",
      "*   **Sample Exercises (Example Split):**\n",
      "    *   **Day A:** Squats (or Goblet Squats), Dumbbell Bench Press, Barbell/Dumbbell Rows, Overhead Press (cautiously), Leg Press, Core work.\n",
      "    *   **Day B:** Romanian Deadlifts, Lat Pulldowns/Pull-ups, Dumbbell Incline Press, Lunges/Split Squats, Face Pulls, Biceps, Triceps.\n",
      "*   **Cardio:** 3-4 days/week, 30-45 minutes, potentially introducing moderate HIIT.\n",
      "*   **Crucial:** Implement progressive overload. Ensure adequate nutrition and recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 4: Advanced Training & Goal Refinement (Month 6+)**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Goal:** Continue building strength and muscle, potentially incorporating more powerlifting specifics while prioritizing shoulder health.\n",
      "*   **Frequency:** 4-5 days/week, more specialized splits possible.\n",
      "*   **Key Focus:** Gradual introduction of heavier barbell lifts (if shoulder is pain-free), accessory work for shoulder stability, periodization.\n",
      "*   **Crucial:** Continually listen to your body. Never push through significant pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "### II. Nutrition Plan: Fueling Your Recovery and Goals\n",
      "\n",
      "This plan focuses on supporting muscle growth, fat loss, and tissue repair.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Calorie Target:** Approximately **1600 kcal/day** for weight loss with muscle maintenance.\n",
      "*   **Macronutrient Goals:**\n",
      "    *   **Protein:** ~150-160 grams/day (crucial for muscle repair and satiety)\n",
      "    *   **Fat:** ~45-50 grams/day (focus on healthy sources)\n",
      "    *   **Carbohydrates:** ~145-155 grams/day (prioritize complex carbs for energy)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Nutrition Pillars:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Prioritize Protein:** Distribute protein intake throughout the day. Excellent sources include lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, legumes, and protein powder. This is vital for muscle preservation and healing.\n",
      "2.  **Nutrient-Dense Foods:** Base your diet on whole, unprocessed foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.\n",
      "3.  **Healthy Fats:** Include sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil for hormone health and inflammation management.\n",
      "4.  **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water (aim for 8-10 glasses daily), especially around workouts.\n",
      "5.  **Micronutrients:** Pay attention to Calcium, Vitamin D, Magnesium, Zinc, Omega-3s, and Vitamin C through a varied diet rich in colorful fruits and vegetables, and fatty fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample Meal Structure:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Breakfast:** Greek yogurt with protein powder and berries, or scrambled eggs with spinach and whole-wheat toast.\n",
      "*   **Lunch:** Large salad with grilled chicken/turkey/fish, or lean protein with steamed vegetables and a small portion of brown rice/quinoa.\n",
      "*   **Dinner:** Lean protein source (e.g., baked cod, lean beef, chicken thighs) with roasted root vegetables and cruciferous vegetables.\n",
      "*   **Snacks:** Protein shakes, apple with nut butter, cottage cheese, hard-boiled eggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Specific Considerations for Rotator Cuff Recovery:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Protein for Healing:** Ensure you consistently meet your protein targets to aid tissue repair.\n",
      "*   **Anti-Inflammatory Foods:** Incorporate sources of Omega-3 fatty acids (fatty fish, flaxseeds, walnuts) and antioxidants (berries, colorful vegetables) to help manage inflammation.\n",
      "*   **Listen to Your Body:** Adjust food intake based on hunger and energy levels. If you experience consistent fatigue, a slight increase in calories, prioritizing protein and complex carbs, might be necessary as your activity increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "### III. Synergistic Integration & Monitoring\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The Connection:** Your nutrition plan directly supports your fitness goals by providing the energy for workouts, the building blocks for muscle repair and growth, and the nutrients for recovery. Adequate protein intake is paramount for both muscle maintenance during weight loss and for tissue healing. Healthy fats and micronutrients will support overall bodily function and reduce inflammation, crucial for shoulder recovery.\n",
      "*   **Phased Nutrition:** As your activity level increases through the fitness phases, you may need to gradually adjust your calorie intake upwards to match your increased energy expenditure, while maintaining your focus on protein.\n",
      "*   **Monitoring Progress:**\n",
      "    *   **Fitness:** Log your workouts diligently to track progressive overload. Note any shoulder discomfort immediately.\n",
      "    *   **Nutrition:** Monitor weight trends (aim for 0.5-2 lbs loss per week), energy levels, and hunger. Adjust calorie intake slightly if needed.\n",
      "    *   **Overall:** Take measurements and progress photos monthly. Most importantly, listen to your body and consult with healthcare professionals (doctor, physical therapist) as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This integrated plan provides a roadmap for your wellness journey. Consistency, patience, and a mindful approach to both your training and nutrition will be key to your success.\n"
